Okay, to be honest I was so scared of this last time I took the course and I just felt left alone and sat down as if I knew nothing in the middle of this giant tech world.
With out further delay I just dropped out of the class after couple classes and always asked myself why?
But I was not given a chance to escape this class all the time, this semester, I am here again, entering with the same fear.
I was freaking out again and again till I actually sat down and started coding stuff. I was little nervous in the first class, but as the due date for the first project came close, I was pushed to do it.
Then came in some confidence asking not to worry too much but first jjst keep working on. I guess I will be continuing hopefully now....!
